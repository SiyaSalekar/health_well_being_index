Project Overview
The European Health and Well-being Index project aims to develop a comprehensive composite indicator to assess the health and well-being of countries in Europe. The index will provide a single numerical value that enables the comparison of various European nations in terms of their health outcomes, mortality rates, healthcare infrastructure, and socio-economic factors. By synthesizing multiple dimensions of health and well-being into one metric, the index will facilitate informed decision-making, and policy formulation.
Objectives
The objectives of this project are:
•	The project aims to create a composite index that captures key dimensions of health, mortality, and socio-economic factors within European nations. By synthesizing diverse data sources and indicators, the index will provide a comprehensive assessment of the health status and well-being of populations across the region.
•	The creation of this index adheres to established guidelines of selecting relevant indicators, normalizing data, weighting and aggregating indicators, and validating the index to ensure its reliability and validity.
•	The European Health and Well-being Index aims to serve as a tool for comparing the health outcomes and socio-economic development of European countries. By providing a common metric for assessing health and well-being, the index will enable policymakers to identify best practices, evaluate policy interventions, and prioritize areas for improvement to enhance public health and well-being across the region. By synthesizing complex data into a single metric, the index will facilitate evidence-based decision-making and policy formulation in the fields of public health, healthcare provision, and socio-economic development.
